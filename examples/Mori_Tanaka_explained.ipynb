    "The following notebook is intended to explain the various Mori-Tanaka implementations and solution strategies used in HomoPy. The goal is not to derive the equations, but to provide a learning by doing example. A prerequisite is a basic understanding of homogenization methods in the field of elasticity.\n",

The brackets $\\left< \\cdot \\right>_f$ indicate the fiber volume average.\n",
